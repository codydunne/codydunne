I am an Assistant Professor in the [Khoury Vis Lab](https://vis.khoury.northeastern.edu/), part of the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/
) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/
). I create readable visualizations of network relationships that help users understand complex data. I mainly address visualizing layered networks, in which the nodes in the network are constrained to lie on parallel layers. My research leverages the algorithmic aspects of computer science to build and assess new visualization techniques and tools, as well as human-computer interaction (HCI) methodologies to understand the perceptual abilities, goals, tasks, and processes of uses and validate visualization designs. This work has led to my contributing new HCI research methods and novel visualization and HCI theory that can guide future researchers and practitioners. I often use applied research across various domains to help generate novel basic research contributions. These cross-disciplinary collaborations provide me with new questions, data sets, case studies, and invested users whose work benefits from our partnerships.
